# Graph Neural Networks for prediction of molecular excitation spectra
This repository contains the code for the said publication. Four GNN models GIN,GCN,SchNet and MPNN
are trained on the excitation spectra for the QM9data.
The data for training the models, as well as pretrained models are avaialble at insert link
The libraries required for running the code are :
1. ASE
2. Pytorch-Geometric
3. Pytorch
4. RDKit
